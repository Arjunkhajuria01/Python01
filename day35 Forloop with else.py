# for i in range(5):
#     print( i)

# else :
#     print("no there is no i" )


    # IMPORTANT POINT 

    # Take example :- 
for i in range (6):
    print(i)
    if i ==4 :
     break
    
else :
    print("No there is no i")
    # in the above example the else operation will not execute as the loop is not fully completed it is 
    #breaked in between , else statemenet with loop will ony work if it is fully executed first .
