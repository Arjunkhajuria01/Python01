#syntax of if else 
# first taking input 

a = int(input("enter the value of a :  "))
print("your age is :", a )

if(a>= 20 ):
    print("you are a stupid driver")

    #elif 
    #elif is basically using elif between else and if to create multiple scenarios
    
    # num = int(input ("enter the values of a :"))
    # print(" value of a is ", a)

    # if (a >= 10):
    #     print ("If case is passed ")
    # elif( a ==)

    # elif( a == etc)

    # else : 
    #     print ("this is the syntax")
