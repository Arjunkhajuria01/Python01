# f-string is used to for formatting strings
# letter = "hey my name is {0} and im from {1}"
# country = "India"
# name = "Harry"

# print(letter.format(country , name))
# the above is a slow and not a very effective way to format strings

#thats why we use f strings , basically we can now directly add variables
 

# format for fstring :
#  print(f "   ")

# print(f"Hello my name, is {name} and im form {country}")

#another example 
name = input()
price = input()

print(f"Hello my name is {name} and my height is {price:.2f}")
