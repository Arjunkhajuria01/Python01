# while means "JAB TAK"

# syntax :- while "condition":

# eg while everything is ok , complete your responsibilities, dont wait for that doom
# i = 1 
# while(i<=5):
#     print(i)
#     i =  i+1

# while loop with string 


# name = "arjun"
# i = 0 
# while i < len(name):
#     print(name[i])
#     i = i+1

# print numbers 1 to 5
# i = 0 
# while i in range(0,6):
#     print(i)
#     i = i+1

# countdown example 

# count = 5
# while count>0 :
#     print("countdown",count)
#     count = count -1

# print("blast")

# simple sum 
# addnumbers from 1 to 10 using while loop 

# i = 1
# total = 0

# while i <= 10:
#     total = total + i
#     i = i + 1

# print(total)

# Print even numbers from  2 to 10 using while loop 
  
# i = 2

# while i < 11:

#     print(i)

#     i = i+2
# else :
#     print("Everything will be fine")

# while true() is used for infinite loop
